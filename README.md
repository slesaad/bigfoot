Bigfoot is a web app that traces the places you've been to, your road trips and your flights on a map

It takes in the data downloaded from Google maps ([HowTo](https://www.howtogeek.com/725241/how-to-download-your-google-maps-data/)), processes it, and then visualizes it on a map

More info coming soon...
